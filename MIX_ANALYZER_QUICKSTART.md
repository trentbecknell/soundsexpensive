## What Gets Analyzed

### 🔊 Loudness
Is your mix too quiet or over-compressed?
- **Target:** Competitive with streaming platforms
- **Measured in:** LUFS (Loudness Units Full Scale)

### 🎵 Dynamic Range
Does your mix have punch and life?
- **Target:** 5-12 dB depending on genre
- **Issue:** Over-compression makes mixes flat

### 🎚️ Frequency Balance
Are all frequencies properly represented?
- **Sub-bass:** 20-60 Hz (low end weight)
- **Bass:** 60-250 Hz (fundamental warmth)
- **Mids:** 250-2000 Hz (body and presence)
- **Highs:** 2000-20000 Hz (clarity and air)

### 🎧 Stereo Image
How wide and spacious is your mix?
- **Target:** Wide but mono-compatible
- **Measured in:** Stereo width percentage

### 🎯 Genre Fit
Does your mix match genre conventions?
- Tempo (BPM)
- Energy levels
- Typical characteristics

## Understanding Your Score

### 90-100: Outstanding! 🌟
Release-ready. Minor tweaks could perfect it, but you're good to go!

### 80-89: Great Work! ⭐
Very close to professional. Address key issues and you're there.

### 70-79: Good Foundation 👍
Core is solid. Focus on critical and warning issues.

### 60-69: Solid Start 🎯
Has potential. Prioritize critical issues, work through warnings.

### Below 60: Needs Work 🔧
Focus on fundamentals: loudness, frequency balance, dynamics.

## Reading Diagnostic Issues

### 🔴 Critical
**Must fix before release.** Major technical problems.
- Example: "Mix is Too Quiet" (-15 LUFS vs -8 to -5 target)

### ⚠️ Warning
**Should fix for quality.** Noticeable issues affecting sound.
- Example: "Limited Dynamic Range" (4 dB vs 6-10 target)

### 💡 Suggestion
**Consider for optimization.** Polish and refinement.
- Example: "Tempo Outside Genre Norm" (can be intentional)

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### "Mix is Too Quiet"
✅ **Quick Fix:**
- Increase gain during mastering
- Use a limiter to boost perceived loudness
- Check if individual tracks are too low

### "Weak Low End"
✅ **Quick Fix:**
- Boost bass frequencies (60-250 Hz)
- Check bass/kick balance
- Layer bass elements for presence

### "Limited Dynamic Range"
✅ **Quick Fix:**
- Reduce compression on tracks
- Ease up on mastering limiter
- Allow choruses to be louder than verses

### "Narrow Stereo Image"
✅ **Quick Fix:**
- Pan instruments across stereo field
- Use stereo reverb/delay effects
- Double-track and pan guitars/vocals

## Pro Tips

### 1. Reference Tracks 🎧
Compare your mix to 3-5 commercial tracks in your genre
- Match loudness first
- Compare frequency balance
- Check stereo width

### 2. Take Breaks 🧘
Fresh ears are critical
- Work in 45-minute sessions
- Take 10-15 minute breaks
- Sleep on it before final decisions

### 3. Multiple Systems 📱
Check your mix on:

## Troubleshooting

### "File Upload Failed"
