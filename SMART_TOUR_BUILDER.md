# Smart Tour Builder

## Overview
One-click tour generation that builds a complete, profitable tour based on your artist profile. No need to know what band to hire, how many shows to book, or which venues to play - we calculate it all for you.

## The Problem We Solve
Artists often struggle with:
- **"What band do I need?"** - Don't know which musicians to hire for their genre/budget
- **"How many people will come?"** - Unsure of their realistic draw
- **"What's the right budget?"** - No idea what profitable ROI looks like
- **"Which venues should I book?"** - Don't know appropriate tier for their level

## The Solution
Smart Tour Builder analyzes your artist profile (stage, draw, genre) and instantly generates:
1. ✅ **Optimal venue selection** - Right tier and capacity for your draw
2. ✅ **Genre-appropriate band** - Recommended musicians for your style
3. ✅ **Fair pay rates** - AFM union scale adjusted for venue tier
4. ✅ **Complete budget** - Revenue, expenses, musician pay, net profit
5. ✅ **Regional routing** - Efficient tour corridors with mileage estimates

## How It Works

### Step 1: Profile Analysis
Reads from your Artist Roadmap profile:
- **Stage**: Emerging, Developing, Established, Breakout
- **Average Draw**: 20-5000 people (estimated realistic attendance)
- **Genre**: Rock, folk, jazz, hip-hop, country, electronic, etc.

### Step 2: Tour Size Calculation
Recommends show count based on your draw:
- **<50 draw**: 3-show weekend run (local gigs)
- **50-150 draw**: 5-show week-long tour (regional circuit)
- **150-400 draw**: 8-show tour (1.5 weeks, established artist)
- **400-1000 draw**: 12-show tour (2 weeks, breakout level)
- **1000+ draw**: 20-show full tour (national run)

### Step 3: Venue Matching
Selects venues that:
- Match your draw (50-120% of venue capacity = optimal fill rate)
- Align with your genre (rock venues, jazz clubs, folk rooms, etc.)
- Fit your stage (emerging = dive bars, breakout = theaters)
- Are in your preferred region (if selected)

### Step 4: Band Configuration
Genre-specific musician recommendations:

#### Rock/Punk
- **Dive bars**: 3-piece (guitar, bass, drums)
- **Clubs+**: 3-piece + FOH engineer
- **Rationale**: Classic power trio, minimal overhead, industry standard

#### Folk/Singer-Songwriter
- **Dive/Club**: Solo (you + house sound)
- **Mid-size+**: Solo + accompanist + FOH engineer
- **Rationale**: Intimate performances don't need big bands

#### Jazz
- **Dive bars**: Jazz trio (you + bass + drums)
- **Clubs+**: Jazz quartet (you + bass + drums + keys) + FOH
- **Rationale**: Traditional jazz ensemble, upright bass, acoustic focus

#### Hip-Hop/Rap
- **Dive/Club**: MC + DJ/turntablist
- **Mid-size+**: MC + DJ + FOH engineer + tour manager
- **Rationale**: DJ provides backing tracks, larger shows need crew

#### Country/Americana
- **Dive bars**: Trio (you + guitar + bass)
- **Clubs+**: Full band (guitar, bass, drums, pedal steel) + FOH
- **Rationale**: Country fans expect full traditional instrumentation

#### Metal
- **All tiers**: Dual guitars + bass + drums + FOH engineer
- **Rationale**: Metal requires guitar interplay and professional sound

#### Electronic/DJ
- **All tiers**: You + FOH engineer
- **Rationale**: Self-contained setup, engineer handles technical needs

#### Default (Indie)
- **Dive bars**: 3-piece (guitar, bass, drums)
- **Clubs+**: 4-piece (guitar, bass, drums, keys/synth) + FOH
- **Rationale**: Modern indie rock standard lineup

### Step 5: Budget Calculation
Generates complete tour financials:
- **Revenue**: Door splits, guarantees, ticket sales
- **Expenses**: Gas, hotels, per diems, production rental, merch fees
- **Musician Pay**: AFM union scale rates adjusted by tier and tour length
- **Net Profit**: Total revenue - expenses - musician pay
- **ROI Analysis**: Profit margin, warnings if unprofitable

### Step 6: Routing Optimization
Analyzes geographic efficiency:
- Groups venues by regional corridor (Midwest, Southeast, etc.)
- Calculates total tour mileage
- Warns about long drives (500+ miles)
- Suggests tour leg splits for multi-region runs

## Technical Details

### Venue Matching Algorithm
```typescript
1. Filter by stage (Emerging = dive-bar/club, Breakout = theater)
2. Filter by capacity (venue.capacity × 0.5 to × 1.2 of estimatedDraw)
3. Score by genre match (venue.genres overlaps with artist genres)
4. Score by fill rate (closer to 80% capacity = higher score)
5. Sort by combined score
6. Return top N venues (N = tour size)
```

### Band Configuration Logic
```typescript
function getRecommendedBandConfig(genre, venueTier) {
  // Genre-specific rules
  if (genre.includes('rock')) {
    return tier === 'dive-bar' 
      ? ['Guitar', 'Bass', 'Drums']
      : ['Guitar', 'Bass', 'Drums', 'FOH Engineer'];
  }
  // ... (see implementation for full logic)
}
```

### Pay Rate Calculation
Uses AFM union scale adjusted by:
- **Venue tier**: Dive bar = 1.0x, Club = 1.2x, Mid-size = 1.5x, Theater = 2.0x
- **Tour length**: <5 shows = 1.0x, 5-10 = 1.1x, 10+ = 1.2x
- **Member type**: Core = profit share, Session = guaranteed rate

### Profit Distribution
- **Leader (you)**: 40% of net profit (after all expenses + session musician pay)
- **Core members**: Split remaining 60% equally
- **Session musicians**: Guaranteed nightly rate, no profit share

## Success Metrics

How do you know if it's working?

### Green Light (Profitable Tour)
- ✅ **Profit margin 15%+** - Sustainable after paying everyone fairly
- ✅ **Fill rate 60-90%** - Realistic attendance expectations
- ✅ **Total mileage <2000** - Manageable drives without burnout
- ✅ **Regional cohesion** - All shows in 1-2 corridors

### Yellow Light (Risky but Possible)
- ⚠️ **Profit margin 5-15%** - Tight margins, little room for error
- ⚠️ **Fill rate <60% or >100%** - Either overshooting or venues too small
- ⚠️ **Mileage 2000-3500** - Long drives, consider fly dates
- ⚠️ **Multi-region** - Spanning 3+ corridors

### Red Light (Unprofitable)
- 🛑 **Profit margin <5% or negative** - Losing money, don't do this tour
- 🛑 **Fill rate <40%** - Unrealistic expectations for your draw
- 🛑 **Mileage >3500** - Unsustainable driving, guaranteed burnout
- 🛑 **Band too big** - Paying more musicians than revenue supports

When you see red lights, the system suggests:
- Play smaller venues (lower guarantees, easier to fill)
- Reduce band size (fewer musicians to pay)
- Shorten tour (less gas/hotel costs)
- Focus on one region (cut travel expenses)

## Why This Matters

### For Emerging Artists
- **Confidence**: Know you can afford a tour before booking
- **Fairness**: Pay musicians union rates, not exploitative lowballs
- **Realism**: Venues matched to actual draw, not aspirational

### For Developing Artists
- **Expansion**: See which regions are financially viable to expand into
- **Professionalization**: Understand what hiring a crew actually costs
- **ROI**: Know if upgrading from trio to full band makes financial sense

### For Established Artists
- **Efficiency**: Optimize routing to maximize profit per mile driven
- **Scaling**: See when you can graduate from clubs to theaters
- **Crew budgets**: Calculate when you can afford tour manager, lighting tech, etc.

### For All Artists
- **Transparency**: No hidden costs, all math shown
- **Education**: Learn industry standards (AFM rates, expense norms)
- **Empowerment**: Make informed decisions instead of guessing

## Usage Tips

1. **Set realistic draw** - Be honest about attendance to get accurate budgets
2. **Try multiple regions** - Compare Midwest vs Southeast profitability
3. **Experiment with band size** - See how adding/removing musicians affects profit
4. **Check routing warnings** - Long drives kill profit margins via gas/hotels
5. **Review show-by-show** - Some venues may be losers even if tour is profitable overall
6. **Update as you grow** - Re-run when your draw increases to see new opportunities
