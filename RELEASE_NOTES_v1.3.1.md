## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Samply Integration:
- ⚠️ **Estimated Features**: Audio analysis is estimated, not measured
- ⚠️ **Public Playlists Only**: Can't access private playlists
- ⚠️ **20 Track Limit**: Maximum 20 tracks per analysis
- ⚠️ **No Playback**: Can't play audio in the analyzer
- ⚠️ **Scraping-Based**: May need updates if Samply changes their site

**For most accurate results**, use Spotify integration for released tracks that have real audio analysis.
