## 🐛 Common Questions

### "Why can't I paste a Samply URL?"

**Answer**: Browser security (CORS) blocks direct fetching of Samply pages. This is a standard web security feature that prevents websites from accessing content from other domains. While we tried multiple workarounds, the most reliable method is download & upload.

**The Good News**: Downloading and uploading gives you BETTER analysis anyway!

### "Is this a lot of work?"

**Answer**: Nope! It's actually quite fast:
1. Download tracks: ~30 seconds
2. Upload to analyzer: ~15 seconds  
3. Run analysis: ~10 seconds

Total: About 1 minute for a full catalog analysis!

### "What about Spotify integration?"

**Answer**: Spotify works differently:
- **Spotify**: Direct URL import ✅ (uses official API)
- **Samply**: Download & upload ✅ (better audio analysis)

Both methods work great - use what fits your workflow!

### "Can I analyze tracks I haven't released yet?"

**Answer**: Absolutely! That's the perfect use case for Samply tracks:
- Upload demos and WIP tracks
- Get professional analysis
- Make informed decisions about which to release
- Track your progress over time
