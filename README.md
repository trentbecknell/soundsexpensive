## 💡 How It Works

The Artist Roadmap uses an **analysis-first approach** that ensures data-driven planning:

### 1. Catalog Analysis (Analyze Your Current State)
Start by understanding where you are today:
- **Upload or connect your music** via Spotify URL or direct file upload
- **Multi-track analysis** assesses quality, consistency, and sonic identity
- **Quality progression tracking** shows improvement trends over time
- **Genre and style consistency** reveals your sonic fingerprint
- **Actionable insights** highlight strengths and growth opportunities

### 2. Strategic Planning Chat (Plan Your Next Move)
Have a focused conversation about your goals:
- **Context-aware AI** references your catalog analysis results
- **Planning-focused questions** about timeline, budget, and goals
- **Smart suggestions** based on your actual music quality and quantity
- **Progress tracking** ensures comprehensive planning (minimum 3 responses)
- **No personality tests** - just practical, forward-looking strategy

### 3. Smart Roadmap Generation (Build Your Path Forward)
Automatically generate an intelligent project plan:
- **Data-driven project type** (Album/EP/Singles) based on catalog quality and quantity
- **Realistic timeline** adjusts for your maturity level and catalog readiness
- **Budget estimation** scales with project scope and includes grant opportunities
- **Phase-based tasks** organized from Discovery → Release → Growth
- **Visual charts** for timeline and budget analysis

### 4. Returning User Experience
Personalized dashboard for users with existing progress:
- **Welcome back greeting** with time-of-day awareness
- **Status overview** showing catalog analysis, roadmap, and grant tracking
- **Quick actions** to continue where you left off
- **No forced re-onboarding** - jump straight back into your work

### Why This Flow Works
1. **Real data drives decisions** - analyze actual music before planning
2. **No wasted effort** - catalog insights inform every recommendation
3. **Faster to value** - skip repetitive setup on return visits
4. **Context-aware planning** - chat knows your music's strengths and gaps
5. **Smart defaults** - roadmap suggestions based on proven patterns
