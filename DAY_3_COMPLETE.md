## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### 1. Portfolio as Wrapper Pattern
**Decision**: Portfolio state wraps individual artist states  
**Rationale**: 
- Preserves existing app architecture
- Each artist has complete `AppState` instance
- Easy to switch between artists
- No refactoring of existing components

**Structure**:
```typescript
Portfolio {
  artists: ArtistRecord[] {
    ArtistRecord {
      id: string
      profile: { artistName, genres, city }
      state: AppState  // Full app state per artist
      timestamps
    }
  }
  activeArtistId: string
  settings: PortfolioSettings
}
```

### 2. Auto-Migration Strategy
**Decision**: Automatic migration from legacy single-artist to portfolio format  
**Rationale**:
- Zero data loss for existing users
- Seamless upgrade experience
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Original data preserved as backup

**Migration Flow**:
1. Detect legacy `artist-roadmap-vite-v1` key
2. Create portfolio with single artist
3. Save to new `artist-roadmap-portfolio` key
4. Keep legacy key updated (safety net)
5. Log migration to console

### 3. Conditional Portfolio Tab
**Decision**: Portfolio tab only appears when 2+ artists exist  
**Rationale**:
- Single-artist users don't need portfolio management
- Clean UI for beginners
- Clear signal when portfolio capabilities unlock
- Reduces cognitive load

### 4. Multi-Mode Dashboard
**Decision**: Single dashboard component with 3 modes (normal, compare, bulk)  
**Rationale**:
- Code reuse (shared grid, filters, search)
- Consistent user experience
- Easy mode switching
- Reduced bundle size vs. separate components

### 5. Investment Readiness Algorithm
**Decision**: Weighted scoring algorithm (60% stage, 20% quality, 20% completion)  
**Rationale**:
- Stage scores reflect long-term artist development
- Catalog quality indicates immediate release potential
- Completion bonuses reward thorough planning
- 0-100 scale is intuitive for industry professionals
